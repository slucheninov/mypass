# Vendored: Apple password-manager-resources (quirks/password-rules.json)

- Upstream: https://github.com/apple/password-manager-resources
- Vendored file: quirks/password-rules.json
- Commit: $COMMIT_SHA
- Retrieved on: $RETRIEVAL_DATE
- Entry count at that commit: $ENTRY_COUNT

The vendored JSON is committed as-is, with no reformatting, so a future
\`git diff\` against upstream stays readable. Regenerate with
\`scripts/update-password-rules.sh\` -- this file and \`password-rules.json\`
are always rewritten together, in the same run, so they can never
independently drift out of sync (see that script for why: it is exactly
the same commit/date/count triple recorded here, plus a fresh copy of
upstream's own LICENSE.md, generated fresh on every run).

## Licence

Copied verbatim from upstream's \`LICENSE.md\` at the commit above:

EOF

cat "$WORK_DIR/repo/$UPSTREAM_LICENSE_FILE" >> "$PROVENANCE_TMP"

# Move both into place back-to-back, with nothing else in between that could
# fail -- this is the earliest point at which either target's old content is
# disturbed.
mv "$DATA_TMP" "$DATA_TARGET"
mv "$PROVENANCE_TMP" "$PROVENANCE_TARGET"

echo "Updated $DATA_TARGET ($ENTRY_COUNT entries) and $PROVENANCE_TARGET at commit $COMMIT_SHA."
